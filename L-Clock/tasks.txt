Immediately before release:
	Test on all API's and screen sizes
	In all projects, set release date in strings and version in strings and manifest
	Clean before compiling
	Install old version from Market to make sure update from Market works properly
	Save sources along with binary for each release version

Research:
	Online sources:
		http://spaceflightnow.com/tracking/
		http://nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html
		http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/launches/launch_schedule.html
		http://kennedyspacecenter.com/events.aspx (countdown for next rocket launch at top-left)

Problems:
	Text in main screen in landscape mode

1.0.0:
	Look for major features in MissionClock to include, maybe get some style ideas too
	Countdown for end of launch window
	Don't say "Launch!" unless it can actually be confirmed
	Synchronized countdown for STS-133 at very minimum

Bin:
